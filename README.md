# 🏦 Automate Credit Card Offers

**Personal project**: what started as a way to save time clicking through Amex, Chase, and Citi credit card offers turned into a demo of how AI + automation can streamline repetitive, browser-based workflows.  

Each script was built with Python, Selenium, and Google Sheets API — co-written with ChatGPT to accelerate debugging and handle messy edge cases. The same pattern could be applied to any tedious, click-heavy process in marketing, analytics, or operations.

## ✨ Why this matters
On the surface, it’s about auto-enrolling in coffee discounts. But under the hood, it demonstrates:

- **Data Enablement** → raw UI clicks transformed into structured rows and normalized fields  
- **Automation** → 100+ tedious actions executed in seconds with zero manual effort  
- **AI-Assisted Development** → LLMs used for parsing rules, error handling, and workflow design  
- **Business Translation** → a pattern that scales beyond credit cards:  
  - Automate data ingestion  
  - Normalize messy inputs  
  - Reduce errors  
  - Free up humans for higher-value work

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Selenium, gspread, dotenv, etc.)  
- **Google Sheets API** for storage & reporting  
- **Browser automation** with Chrome user profiles  
- **Environment-based secrets** (no credentials committed)  
- **LLM-assisted coding** for debugging and resilient workflow design

## 📈 Business Takeaway
What looks like “clicking coupons faster” is actually a **demo of scalable data enablement**: turning inconsistent, human-only processes into reproducible, auditable pipelines.  

This project shows how even small, personal automations can illustrate the same principles used in marketing ops and data enablement: saving time, reducing errors, and scaling consistency.
